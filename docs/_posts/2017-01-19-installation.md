If you're going to do science or statistics with Python, especially if you're new to coding, Anaconda is the best way to go. It works on OSX, Windows, and Linux operating systems right out of the box, and comes bundled with the most popular libraries currently used for science.

Anaconda is a commercial redistribution of Python plus numeric libraries. The vendor, Continuum Analytics, provides it for free to gain an audience, and then Anaconda contracts with businesses to maintain a consistent corporate Python environment. And you benefit.


## Why Python?

In the Chicago region in 2015, the distribution of end uses by people in the local [Python club][chipy] was 1/3 for data science, 1/3 for web development, and 1/3 for devops (intermediate work related to keeping all of the parts of the computer system working). 


```python
print('hello world')
print('foo ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss')
```
